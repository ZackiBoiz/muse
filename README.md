- Make a social computing activity
	- music naturally engages other people
	- people can play together
- Motivate computational/programmatic ideas from familiar concepts
	- i.e. want to loop arises naturally when trying to make songs
- Make sweet intro demo for club opener

	- [] start
	- [] stop
- [] why does it stop working after too many calls
- [] adding left recursion?
- [] add loops
- [] js interpolation
- [] set envelope qualities
- [x] pauses
- [] tempo
- [x] threads
- [x] a better editor
	- [] syntax highlighting
- [] realtime controls/instruments

# Thanks to

- Tevan
- Lux for helping make the sound prettier by eliminating the ugly clicking noise

# Notes

- Instead of adding js interpolation to program, make interpreter for tagged template literal
- should repeat with x work both ways, 3 x a4 == a4 x 3
	- latter of the two could be slightly ambigious as to whether it's repeat 3 more times or repeat 3 times total
- unpitched rythmic component
	- drums have sharp decay and fast attack
